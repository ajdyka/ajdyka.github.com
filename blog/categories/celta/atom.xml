    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow I begin a four week course, "Cambridge ESOL Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults (<a href="http://www.cambridgeesol.org/exams/celta/index.html">CELTA</a>)" at <a href="http://www.attc.edu.au/">ATTC</a>.</p>

<p>By all reports it's pretty full on, 9-5:30 weekdays with homework every night as well as some weekend prep time being required. I sure won't be bored!</p>

<p>This is a bit of a deviation from my existing career in CFML web development, and there's a good reason for that!</p>

<!--MORE-->


<p>As probably already know, Tasmin and I are <a href="/about/">moving to Hong Kong</a>, in fact she is already there getting our new appartment ready while I finish things off in Sydney.</p>

<p>This has meant that I have started looking for work in HK already, and honestly it's been pretty difficult finding any CFML being used there at all (which somewhat surprised me!).</p>

<p>I've been doing the obligitory Google searches, researching and hitting up local job hunting sites and even contacted a few recruitment agents to no avail.</p>

<p>At this point rather than 'putting all of my eggs in one basket', I thought it would be an appropriate time to enhance some of my other skills and get CELTA certified. (I already posess a Certificate IV in Assessment and Workplace Training and a TEFL Certificate)</p>

<p>I'm still optimistic that I can pick up some remote consultancy work so I can maintain my CFML skills. In the event I cannot find anything permenant, I'll have the CELTA qualificaiton to fall back on either in the capacity of classroom teacher or private tutor.</p>

<p>Over the coming weeks I'll post details on my progress through the course, keep an eye on the category:<a href="/blog/categories/celta/">celta</a> for all related posts!</p>
