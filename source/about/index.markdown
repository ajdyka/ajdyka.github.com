{% blockquote AJ Dyka, 6 weeks prior to departure %}
As I write this I have only 6 weeks untill I start what will probably be the biggest adventure of my life ...
{% endblockquote %}

Tasmin and I have made the decision to move to Hong Kong!

It's been a long time coming and took a great deal of thought to come to this decision but it's case of being the right time to give living in HK a try.

It's also time for me to start picking up some more technologies and Octopress as a 'hackers' blogging framework in conjunction with git seems like a good place to start!

I don't imagine this will be a day-by-day blogging effort so we'll see how it goes :)
