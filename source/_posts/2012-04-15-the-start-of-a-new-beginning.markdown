Tomorrow I begin a four week course, "Cambridge ESOL Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults ([CELTA](http://www.cambridgeesol.org/exams/celta/index.html))" at [ATTC](http://www.attc.edu.au/).

By all reports it's pretty full on, 9-5:30 weekdays with homework every night as well as some weekend prep time being required. I sure won't be bored!

This is a bit of a deviation from my existing career in CFML web development, and there's a good reason for that!

As probably already know, Tasmin and I are [moving to Hong Kong](/about/), in fact she is already there getting our new appartment ready while I finish things off in Sydney.

This has meant that I have started looking for work in HK already, and honestly it's been pretty difficult finding any CFML being used there at all (which somewhat surprised me!).

I've been doing the obligitory Google searches, researching and hitting up local job hunting sites and even contacted a few recruitment agents to no avail.

At this point rather than 'putting all of my eggs in one basket', I thought it would be an appropriate time to enhance some of my other skills and get CELTA certified. (I already posess a Certificate IV in Assessment and Workplace Training and a TEFL Certificate)

I'm still optimistic that I can pick up some remote consultancy work so I can maintain my CFML skills. In the event I cannot find anything permenant, I'll have the CELTA qualificaiton to fall back on either in the capacity of classroom teacher or private tutor.

Over the coming weeks I'll post details on my progress through the course, keep an eye on the category:[celta](/blog/categories/celta/) for all related posts!
