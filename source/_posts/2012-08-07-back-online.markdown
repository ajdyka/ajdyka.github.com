The haitus has been a bit longer than I anticipated, but a lot has happened!

<!-- more -->

The CELTA course took a lot more out of me than I anticipated, in face it left basically me no time to do anything that wasn't course related for the 4 weeks that it ran.

After the course finished I spent two weeks catching up with family and friends back home in Victoria before flying out to Hong Kong.

Since I landed here it's been a matter of acclimatisation both to the weather and the lifestyle :) I think I've settled in pretty well â€¦ while I haven't made any new friends as such I've been becomming familiar with the area that we live in (Ma On Shan, New Territories) and applying for a bunch of jobs, both IT and NET (Native English Teaching).
